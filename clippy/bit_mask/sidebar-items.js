This cannot work because the bit that makes up the value two was zeroed out by the bit-and with 1. So the formula for detecting if an expression of the type  `_ <bit_op> m <cmp_op> c` (where `<bit_op>` is one of {`&`, '|'} and `<cmp_op>` is one of {`!=`, `>=`, `>` , `!=`, `>=`, `>`}) can be determined from the following table:"]]});
